## Methods:

Before doing anything else, linked all html files to both my style sheet and to bootstrap. Linked all three html files to the same css stylesheet because I knew the design would be simple and to make it easier to apply changes across all pages.

Started by pulling various strings of code from Bootstrap, starting with the navbar, since this was to be used across all three pages. Tweaked accordingly to my own needs, and decided to leave the style mostly alone.

Some rows and cols on the about me page for proper formatting/ in order to get text next to the picture. Slight addition in code for different sized screens. This is also when I decided to go make the "copyright" footer for a more official look (shoutout to Shelly for making this stick to the bottom of each page.)

Portfolio page pretty tricky. Still not sure if done the correct way, or the most succinct. Kind of just tinkered with it until I thought it looked nice. When I tinkered more, it looked like a tornado hit it, so I reverted back. Another container, more rows and cols, and an attempt to make it look nice on different sized devices.

Contact page very straightforward. Used a container and some simple stylings (solid black border) to make it look nice as I did with other pages. Pulled all necessary form coding from bootstrap.
